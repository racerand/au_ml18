If you do not solve the exercise, focus on understanding the question, and try to figure out what it is you do not understand.**\n",

This is called *supervised learning* because the supervisor provides a correct answer. In the second task, his supervisor did not give him a correct answer. Instead, Ben had to group the audio samples based on similarity. This is called *unsupervised learning*, because there is not supervision in terms of correct answers. \n",
