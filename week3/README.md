# Week 3 Exercises
The exercises for week 3 can be found here. Remember to look at all the exercises before class.

This week the main coding exercise is quite comprehensive.
There are not so many theoretical questions but some of them are very hard.
So if time runs out ensure that you have read at least read all the exercises.

Everyone should consider the first theory exercise which asks you to prepare a five minute exam on Linear Regression.

Now get started with the exercises (download the notebooks to work with them).

The suggested order is as follows (except all must look at first theory exercise).
* [Coding Exercise: Plotting lines (hyperplanes)](hyperplanes.ipynb)
* [Coding Exercise: Linear Classifiers making Nonlinear decisions](description_nonlinear.ipynb)
Remember to download **code_nonlinear.py** as well
* [Theory Exercies](theory.ipynb)
